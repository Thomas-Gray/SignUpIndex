              <summary><h3>Why have you made this website?</h3></summary>
              <p class="faq">I get extremely frustrated when searching for discount codes only to land on the same few clickbait sites, that don't actually have any discount codes, and are there just to farm clicks. As well as this, a friend had asked me to put together a list of websites that gave you cash for signing up, and I thought this would be useful to share. </p>

          <details>
              <summary><h3>Will you make money off this website?</h3></summary>
              <p class="faq">The codes and referral links listed are either generic codes, or ones linked to me, so if they are used, it is likely I will benefit.</p>

              <summary><h3>Can't I just copy the website and replace the codes/referral links with my own?</h3></summary>
              <p class="faq">Of course, you could even make a direct copy of the website with your own links (in fact, the source for the website is <a href="https://github.com/Thomas-Gray/SignUpIndex">here</a>). I'd rather you used my codes in return for creating and maintaining this table, but I can't stop you, I'm just text in a FAQs section of a website.</p>

              <summary><h3>Can I get one of my own codes on this website?</h3></summary>
              <p class="faq">If it's a product/service that I have a referral for, I will use my own. However if there is a product/service that you have a referral for that I do not use, let me know and I will add it to the table with your link/code.</p>
